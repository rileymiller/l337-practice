# Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,0,1,2,2,5,6]` might become `[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```

## Run-Time Complexity
Worst-case complexity of this solution would be O(N) since there could be a case where both subtrees are checked.

However, the average case would be O(log n)

Need to double check this, not sure if that's actually the case.
